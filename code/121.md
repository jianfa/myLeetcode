# Problem: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## 描述 Description
> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

> If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

> Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.


## 例子 Example

## 分析 Analysis

核心思想：
Dynamic programming. Use two state variable to store the profit state after buy or after sell. Initialize buy variable with negative infinity.
> 思路1：
>> 时间复杂度：O(n)
>> 空间复杂度：O(1)


## 解决方案 Solution
```

```
### 1.

> 时间复杂度：O(n)
> 空间复杂度：O(1)

### Python


```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # input control
        if not prices:
            return 0
        buy = float('-Inf')  # profit after buy
        sell = 0  # profit after sell
        for price in prices:
            sell = max(sell, buy + price)
            buy = max(buy, -price)
        return sell  
```
